# Java-database
Creating a system to manage a computer hardware stock. To
be able to create such system, many considerations must be made. The
Database which should handle all the data must be build. The
design of the system must follow some particular model. The system must con-
tain data set of different components such as CPU, RAM, Mainboard, GPU &
a Case, not only that but the database should also hold the stock data such as
current stock, preferred amount and minimum amount. To keep the database
well structured and designed, E/R models and relational models are used to
keep the cool perspective in mind when designing, to keep duplicate data from
happening.
The second part of building a system to manage computer hardware stock,
is to create an user interface for the employee to make the database system
accessible and easy to manage through the commandline. This can be accomplished by creating a Java
application with Javaâ€™s JDBC library that allows Java to run SQL queries for
management of the database and giving the employee the ability to print out the
next restock on weekends. Buying a component or a computer system
should be available to the user though the Java application.
